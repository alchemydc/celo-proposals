# CGP [0007]: Add Zcash (ZEC) to Celo Reserve

- Date: 2020-06-15
- Author(s): @alchemydc
- Status: DRAFT
- Governance Proposal ID #: TBD
- Date Executed: TBD

## Overview

This proposal requests that the Celo community add Zcash (ZEC) to the basket of currencies used to stabilize the value of Celo stable assets (initially cUSD).

Zcash meets the requirements specified by the Celo community, as described in [this post](https://medium.com/celoorg/the-celo-reserve-faqs-f3f7cbb1991f), specifically:

>What are the criteria for selecting reserve assets? Reserve asset selection is done through governance by the community. At the moment, any new reserve assets under consideration should be freely traded and settled 24/7 on liquid markets, and should be based on an open-source protocol.

## Why Zcash

### Background
Zcash was created in 2016, as a code fork of Bitcoin.  Unlike Bitcoin, Zcash uses ZK-SNARKs to provide robust on-chain privacy.  Zcash is traded 24x7 on some of the most well known and highly regulated [exchanges](https://z.cash/exchanges/), and enjoys [relatively deep liquidity](https://messari.io/screener/use-E8EB413C).

### Mission Alignment
Zcash development is supported by the [Electric Coin Company](https://electriccoin.co/about/) as well as by the non-profit [Zcash Foundation](https://www.zfnd.org/).  The mission of the Electric Coin Company is very closely aligned with the mission of the Celo project.  Both the ECC and Celo Foundation are dedicated to increasing economic freedom and opportunity for the citizens of the world.  The ECC has recently created a program called [Crypto in Context](https://underestimated.electriccoin.co/) which works actively to use cryptocurrency to onboard "the unbanked" into the new world of crypto-enabled finance.  Elena Giralt from the ECC team also facilitated a workshop on the relationship between privacy and economic freedom at the inaugural Celo retreat in 2019.

### Development Funding
Funding for ongoing development of Zcash was recently renewed by the Zcash community, representing 20% of issuance for the four years from Nov 2020 through Nov 2024.  The funding will be split between the ECC (7%), the Zcash Foundation (5%), and a newly created Major Grants fund (8%).  Zcash Major Grants funding could be used to fund interoperability between the Zcash and Celo networks, for example to automate rebalancing of the target reserve allocation.

### Cryptographic DNA
The Zcash project was founded upon strong science, and the academic work of the Zcash [scientific founders](https://electriccoin.co/team/#scientists) has been foundational to various aspects of cryptocurrency.  Notably, [Eran Tromer](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/), who was one of the Zcash founding scientists, is also an advisor to the Celo project. Tromer has recently contributed to the development of the new [Plumo light client protocol](https://docs.zkproof.org/pages/standards/accepted-workshop3/proposal-plumo_celolightclient.pdf), which leverage ZK-SNARKs to enable mobile devices to use Celo without downloading the entire blockchain.

## Proposed Changes
The present target allocation of the Celo reserve is as follows:
* 50% CELO
* 30% BTC
* 15% ETH
* 5% DAI

This proposal advocates that the target allocation of the Celo reserve be modified as follows:
* 50% CELO
* 27% BTC
* 13% ETH
* 5% DAI
* 5% ZEC


## Verification
This proposal involves no code changes or verification.  

## Risks
Zcash is a cryptocurrency, similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum and DAI, the other assets in the Celo reserve.  Zcash has a considerably smaller market cap than Bitcoin or Ethereum, but this is in-part due to the project being younger and earlier along in its issuance schedule.

Zcash leverages novel cryptography.  The ZK-SNARKs used to provide strong on-chain privacy are also complex and are sometimes referred to as "moon math".  Stealth inflation bugs may exist.  The ECC team has [worked successfully](https://electriccoin.co/blog/zcash-counterfeiting-vulnerability-successfully-remediated/) to remediate such a bug in the past.  That said, the Zcash mainnet has been live since November of 2016, and has proven robust and resilient to attack since launch.

The target allocation proposed above takes into account these risks, and helps the Celo project further diversify the reserve while partnering with a project that represents strong ideological and technical alignment.
